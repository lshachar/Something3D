Check out this very detailed video I made [here](https://youtu.be/JVCmWvRvEYM).  
(It's in Hebrew... I Don't think anyone outside of Israel have ever heard about this 3D printer company.)  
I bought mine in 2013 and it worked awfully until 2021, when I fixed all the issues it had.  
The purpose of this git is to help owners of a Something3D printer to make it into a usable machine!    

If you'd like to update your Marlin Firmware, and use my settings,  
Download [Marlin 2.0.1](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/releases/tag/2.0.1)  
Use my Configuration.h & Configuration_adv.h files.

If you'd like to use a newer Marlin you can compare (diff) these two files on this github,  
to their original version that you have downloaded.  
Then download a newer Marlin firmware, and edit the two new files with all the necessary changes from my files.
